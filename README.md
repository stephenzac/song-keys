# song-keys

A website to display the musical keys of songs that I've been curating. 

When I listen to music, I like to figure out the key of the song in concert pitch. Then, I use a Python script that calls the Spotify API, and stores the song information associated with the musical key I provide, into a JSON file. 

Check out which songs I've figured out the key to! :)
